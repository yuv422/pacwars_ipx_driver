							PACWARS
							-------

GENERAL
-------

PacWars is  a Multi User game based around the Pac Man theme for 
IBM compatibles with 286 processors or above and register compatible 
VGA cards.  Pacwars was written for Novell Netware ver 2.15.

For maximum enjoyment PacWars should really be played with two or more
players.
 
We feel that pacwars still has great scope for growth and we would be 
grateful for any suggestions for improving the game. 

ADDITIONS TO PACWARS
--------------------

PacWars now allows you to edit characters, this function can be invoked
by typing 
	
            PACWARS EDIT

Here are a few instructions to help you along.

The initial screen shows you a list of Current pacmen. Choose the one you wish
to edit.  Saving from this page will update the characters used in the game.

The second screen allows the selection of a frame for editing.  Another 
character can be loaded into this position or the current one saved to its 
own character file (ie. .PAC files).

Once in the frame editor the F1 key brings up a help page.  The basic rules 
are :-
			Don't change the size of the sprite

			Leave a trailing border, this wipes out the sprite as it moves

				ie. first col, first & last row for characters
					first two cols for bullets
					no border for death sequence
			

Once finished you will be taken back to the initial screen select save to 
save your current list of pacmen.


OTHER DEVELOPMENTS
------------------

We are currently working on other Multi user games at the moment

		1.  A multiuser Tank battle.

        2.  Pacwars - The Sequel, this is similar to the Ultimate
            games of yester year but with all the addictive elements of
            the original Pacwars.

			A screen grab from  Pacwars - The Sequel is included, just type
            PWAR3D.

Development of these products may be hindered due to lack of a network, but
there are chances of us setting up a new network real soon.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR PACWARS
------------------------

Moving
------
 
Use the arrow keys to move the pacman in the direction of the arrow.
	
Firing
------

The space bar enables the pac man to fire one bullet at a time.
Each bullet costs 10 points so you will only be able to fire if you
have enough cash. 

	
Invisibility
------------

Pressing the I key during game play will turn your pacman invisible 
for about 10 seconds, during which time you will be unable to shoot.
Invisibility will then not be available for another 20 seconds. However
if any other player has the Infra red spectacles and enables them then
they will be able to see you. If you have been killed recently then 
invisibility will not be available for another 20 seconds.

Gold
----

At random times during gameplay gold bars will appear in one of the 
rooms of the playing field. This gold will be worth varying amounts.
To collect 	the gold just run over it with your pac person. If any
Pac Person shoots the gold they will become 'WANTED' and a bounty 
will be awarded to whoever kills the outlaw. The person who is an
outlaw is shown in the bottom right hand corner of the screen 
alongside the prize given for killing them.

Radar
-----
	
When gold or any other special feature has appeared a flashing square 
will appear on the layout map. This tells you which room the object
is in. 


Special features
----------------

Throughout gameplay special objects will appear, some will help, others
will hinder.

Invisible Shot. Gives you the ability to fire while invisible,
great for catching pac people unawares. Beware of IR specs.

Glass of beer. Worth five hundred points, however you will become
drunk and will stagger while moving for a short period of time.  If
shot everyone else in the room will become drunk.

Glue pot. Take this and you are stuck where you stand for a shortish 
period of time... Pretty Nasty this. Again if shot everyone else in
the room will be stuck.

Bomb. Take this and all other pac people in the same room as you will
die. Shoot the bomb and everybody , including yourself, in that  room 
will die.

Infrared Spectacles. Gives you the ability to see invisible pac people
press 'V' to invoke and follow those heat traces.

Shield. Protects the wearer from bullets coming head-on. Press 'S' to
invoke then make sure you are facing the bullets.  Run Away and your dead.

Grenade. 'G' pulls the pin then press SPACE to throw. When the grenade 
comes to a stop it will explode killing EVERYONE in the room. An object of 
mass destruction useful when the PEARL is about.

Warp. Each warp token gives you the ability to warp twice. To invoke
press 'W' and you will appear in a different place .

Bouncy Walls.  Bullets bounce off the walls allowing you to kill the 
unwary, as well as yourself.
	
Homing Missile.  An excellent tool for revenge. Once you have picked
up the homing missile  pressing  the 't' key  will place a missile 
symbol next to person you wish to kill, the next time you press fire 
the missile will begin to home in. Whilst the missile is in flight
you will be unable to fire any bullets. You will get two missiles 
for this token.

Question Mark.   This can be any of the special features except of 
course the Pearl.

Pearl Pod.  At certain times a pod containing a pearl, or perhaps a
question mark, will appear. We will let you figure out how to get the 
contents of the pod yourself.

A note about PacBaby.
---------------------

In the space between the last version of PacWars and this one, the
creator of this game became the proud father of a little girl. The
character PacBaby was added as a tribute to Iain's achievement 
( and his wive's). You will notice there is no death sequence for 
PacBaby, this was considered to be extreme bad taste (yes even for 
us) so a congratulatory message is displayed instead.




Scoring.
--------

Points 

100         for shooting another Pac Person.
5000        for collecting the Pearl.
500         for collecting the beer.
Random      for collecting the gold.
Random      for killing an outlaw Pac Person.


Installation.
-------------

At the moment the path is set up as  '.\' pacwars will look in the current 
directory for the data files or use the following and put PACWARS.EXE in 
the path.

PACWARS PACPATH (directory path)     
	
i.e
	
PACWARS PACPATH F:\PACWARS\

this will initialise pacwars to look in the directory specified by
directory path for the sprite files and hiscore tables. Please remember
the slash at the end of the path.

To run pacwars change into the relevent directory and type
	PACWARS

ON GOING DEVELOPMENTS

Further Developments to Pacwars that are currently underway are as follows

1.   Faster network handling - not a big change.
     Support for Netware 386 - due to our old company going down the 
     development of Pacwars has been slightly interrupted due to the
     lack of a network.

2.   Multiple mazes. Randomly chosen arenas.      

3.   More people on at the same time.

4.   Team Playing

Obviously the above features will only be given to the people who register 
Pacwars with us.
